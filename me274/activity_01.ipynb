    "+ Use data from driver feedback signs to quantify the distribution of speeds that drivers choose given a posted speed limit.\n",

The banked turn is a common feature of highways, railways, and roller coasters. The banked turn allows the vehicle to go around it at a higher speed than would be possible if the road surface was flat.\n",
